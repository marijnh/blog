The concept of an object, record, structure, or product type occurs in
almost every programming language. Being able to declare a type of
value that groups a number of other values together is a fundamentally
useful thing.

As similar as the various record-ish constructs are in their basic
functionality, the way such values are actually looked at and handled
can be rather sharply divided in two different styles. Some
programming languages or systems strictly prescribe one or the other,
but in many cases you can use both.

## Reference Semantics

Records are implemented as a piece of memory where their content is
laid out at adjacent memory positions. The way to identify such a
record value is by its memory address.

Memory can be changed, so records can be changed. You can write new
values into their fields, and thus the content of a record changes
over its lifetime.

But it's still the same record, even though some of its fields may
have changed value. So the way to compare two records is by address.
You're interested in the _identity_ of a record, not so much its
current content. When implementing a hash table that uses records as
keys, you hash the memory addresses.

## Value Semantics

Mathematical product types allow us to treat a group of values as a
single value. A two-dimensional coordinate is a pair of numbers.

In implementing computer programs that manipulate such types, we may
or may not put these numbers in memory somewhere. But that is not
terribly relevant to our programming model.

Changing the x position of an existing coordinate pair is not a thing.
You can create a new record if you need a new pair of coordinates. It
is possible to define algebraic rules on records, defining
equivalences that hold when you perform certain operations on them.

Comparing two records is done by comparing their contents. Whether
they happen to occupy the same memory is immaterial. A hash table with
records as keys obviously hashes their contents.

With value semantics, a record is just the sum (product?) of its
contents, and nothing beyond that. It doesn't have its own _identity_.

## Know Your Semantics

Both of these approaches provide a coherent way of dealing with record
values, and kind of force you to use the whole packageâ€”if you're going
to mutate your record, you probably also need to compare them by
identity. If you're going to make them immutable, you _must_ implement
updates by creating new values, and will generally want to compare by
value, because object identity has little meaning then.

In Haskell, you're going to be using value semantics whether you like
it or not (you probably do like it, or you wouldn't be using Haskell).

In most imperative programming languages there are situations that
call for reference semantics and situations that call for value
semantics. A mutable container or a stateful subsystem is best
implemented with a reference-semantics type. A small composite value
or a data structure where referential transparency is valuable is much
better treated a value.

Some languages provide different constructs for these two types of
records, making it clear what you are dealing with in any given
situation. But many, such as JavaScript, don't. They may not even
provide reasonable mechanisms for indicating what can be mutated and
what is immutable. When working with such a crude language it is
important to be aware of the way a given type is intended to be used.

All this is to say, when a JavaScript type provides no operations that
change its content, when the TypeScript types list its fields as
`readonly`, and the author goes on about it being an immutable type in
the documentation, please stop mutating its properties and wondering
why things break.
