Last week, the need for a platform to publish [my bi-directional text
story][bidi] on forced me to think about blogging software once more.

I had heard that all the cool kids are now using [Jekyll][jek] on
their [Github][gh] pages to publish their blogs. I am not keen on
depending on Github for yet another aspect of my online life, but the
idea of generating a static site from a git repository does sound
appealing.

Setting up a simple site with Jekyll was a breeze. It really is a
well-designed approach. But I also immediately ran into its
limitations. Something as simple as sorting my list of tags by the
amount of posts they contain was... apparently not possible without
monkey-patching some classes from a plug-in.

Now I have all the respect in the world for the Ruby community and
their anarchist approach to modularity, but such shenigans just don't
fit my own sense of aesthetic. On the other hand, templating languages
like Liquid, which Jekyll uses, are not nearly anarchist enough for my
taste—they strictly forbid any kind of interesting logic to be placed
in the template. I'm sure this is a good thing in some projects with
some teams. But having to add code in another, largely unrelated
place, just to be able to sort a stupid list in a certain way is *not*
helping.

It turned out that, because of Jekyll's brilliant simplicity, cloning
it was easier than figuring out how to monkey-patch it.

Several hours, and two hundred lines of code later, I present to you:
[**Heckle**][heckle], a [node.js][njs]-based Jekyll clone.

It obviously doesn't have all the features of Jekyll—only the core
things that I needed to generate this site. It converts [Markdown][md]
files with a [YAML front matter][fm] to HTML using templates from the
`_layouts` and `_includes` directories. It finds posts in the `_posts`
directory and understands what tags mean. And it copies all other
files in the working directory over to `_site`, where the output ends
up, and which you can then point your web server at.

For templates, Heckle uses a modified version of [Mold][mold], which
was designed for unrestrainedly mixing JavaScript logic into
templates. It was originally designed for client-side instantiation,
and I had to fix some limitations that made it work poorly with
node.js. Those'll probably soon be integrated in the main repository.

The sources for my new blog are on [Github][blog]. I imported some old
posts to make it look less empty. With luck, I'll actually form a
blogging habit this time around.
